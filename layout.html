I want to create a homepage related to this animation. So I'm thinking about what kind of topic to make a site using this animation. So, I look at various scenes in my daily life and think, "Why don't you apply that scene to my site?" However, in order to think like this, shouldn't we first think about what kind of topic to create a site? I created a site related to guitar tutorials before, and I think I made something well. I was such a kid who didn't know my location that I applied for a collaboration with a company called Clover Works. I was rather relieved when he said that the company wasn't receiving personal collaboration. Maybe that's why I'm really thinking about what to make this Bocchi the rock animation site.+2 day On stage one, I made a site promoting this animation-based goodies, and on stage two, I made a site where I could easily and simply watch this animation-related fun short animated video.+3 day I thought the Pokemon card glitter feature I learned recently was more interesting than that feature, so I changed it to a plan to decorate the 2nd page with it.
